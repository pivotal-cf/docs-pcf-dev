This guide describes how to install and use PCF Dev, a lightweight Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) installation that runs on a single virtual machine (VM) on your workstation. PCF Dev is intended for application developers who want to develop and debug their applications locally on a PCF deployment.

PCF Dev includes Pivotal Elastic Runtime, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all cf CLI commands. See the [Comparing PCF Dev to Pivotal Cloud Foundry](#comparison-to-pcf) table below for more product details.

* [Vagrant 1.8+](https://www.vagrantup.com/): Use Vagrant to run the development environment.
* [VirtualBox: 5.0+](https://www.virtualbox.org/): PCF Dev uses VirtualBox as its virtualizer.
* Latest version of [cf CLI](../pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html): Use the cf CLI to push and scale apps.
