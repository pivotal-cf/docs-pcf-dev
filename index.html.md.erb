This guide describes how to install and use PCF Dev, a lightweight Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) installation that runs on a single virtual machine (VM) on your workstation. PCF Dev is intended for application developers who want to develop and debug their applications locally on a PCF deployment.

PCF Dev includes Pivotal Elastic Runtime, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all cf CLI commands. See the [Comparing PCF Dev to Pivotal Cloud Foundry](#comparison-to-pcf) table below for more product details.
