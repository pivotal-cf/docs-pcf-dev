This topic describes how to use PCF Dev to target instances, push an application, and list available marketplace services.

## <a id="pcf-dev"></a>Log in to Your PCF Dev Instance

After starting your PCF Dev instance, use the `cf login` command with the `-a` flag to target its API:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf login -a https<span>:</span>//api.dev.cfdev.sh --skip-ssl-validation
</pre>

To log in as a regular user, enter the following credentials when prompted by the cf CLI:

- **Email:** `user`
- **Password:** `pass`

To log in as an admin user, enter the following credentials when prompted by the cf CLI:

- **Email:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

The terminal displays your API system domain when you run `cf dev start`. In most cases, your API system domain is `api.dev.cfdev.sh`, but it may differ slightly depending on your host system configuration.

## <a id="push"></a>Push an App

Follow the procedure below to push an app to your PCF Dev instance.

1. Navigate to your app directory.

1. Run `cf push APP-NAME`. Replace `APP-NAME` with a name of your choice.

For more information about pushing apps to your deployment, see the [Deploy an Application](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

For more information about using the cf CLI, see the [Getting Started with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html) topic.

## <a id="marketplace"></a>List Marketplace Services

PCF Dev supports marketplace services, giving developers access to Spring Cloud Services, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL.

In order to view the list of available services, run `cf marketplace` in a terminal window. Services that are not started will not appear in marketplace.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org pcfdev-org / space pcfdev-space as admin...
OK

service      plans        description
p-mysql      512mb, 1gb   MySQL databases on demand
p-rabbitmq   standard     RabbitMQ is a robust and scalable high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker.
p-redis      shared-vm    Redis service to provide a key-value store

</pre>

To undeploy a service run `cf dev stop` and redeploy the services of your choosing.

For more information about using marketplace services, see the [Using Services in PCF Dev](dev-services.html) topic.

## <a id="apps-manager"></a>Use Apps Manager

When you start PCF Dev, Apps Manager starts automatically.
Follow the procedure below to access Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to `https://apps.dev.cfdev.sh/`

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If PCF Dev started on a domain other than <code>dev.cfdev.sh</code>, then the Apps Manager URL is different.
For example, if you log in to PCF Dev at <code>api.local.pcfdev.io</code>, then navigate to <a href="https://apps.local.pcfdev.io/">https://apps.local.pcfdev.io/</a> to access Apps Manager.</p>

2. The first time you open Apps Manager after starting the PCF Dev, your browser shows a dialog or page about the security certificate.
Choose to connect to the Apps Manager URL. Alternatively, you can run `cf dev trust` to add the PCF Dev certificate to your OS certificate store. See [here](./configuring.html#trust) for more details.

3. Log in using admin/admin or user/pass. The Pivotal PCF Dev page appears:
